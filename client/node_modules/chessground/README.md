## Features

Chessground is designed to fulfill all lichess.org web and mobile apps needs, so it is pretty featureful.

- Small footprint: 10K gzipped (30K unzipped). No dependencies.
- SVG drawing of circles and arrows on the board
- Entirely configurable and reconfigurable at any time
- Styling with CSS only: board and pieces can be changed by simply switching a class
- Fluid layout: board can be resized at any time
- Support for 3D pieces and boards
- Full mobile support (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- Move pieces by click
- Move pieces by drag'n drop
  - minimum distance before drag
  - centralisation of the piece under the cursor
  - piece ghost element
  - drop off revert or trash
- Premove by click or drag
- Drag new pieces onto the board (editor, crazyhouse)
- Animation of pieces: moving and fading away
- Display last move, check, move destinations, and premove destinations (hover effects possible)
- Import and export positions in FEN notation
- User callbacks
- No chess logic inside: can be used for [chess variants](https://lichess.org/variant)
