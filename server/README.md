# Server information 

## Config file

1. In the server folder create your own config.js file. The config.js file is ignored and wont be version controlled.
2. Copy the code from config.js.sample file and paste it to the config.js file
3. If you do not have the same dbPath, change it to the path you have.

This is necessary for the api url to work when making request to the api.
